 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.

 *
 * == Notes about CSS management
 *
 * Each conference will have it's own CSS files.
 * The manifest will live in './[conference_tag]/application.css.scss'.
 * If we need a separate CSS file for mobile (which we generally
 * shouldn't because we can use media queries instead), then
 * we simply add another manifest in './[conference_tag].s/application.css.scss'.
 *
 * We keep the CSS files as modular as possible to enable reuse
 * in various conferences.
 *
 * Remember that the last CSS rules take precedence. That's
 * why we load theme.css.scss last.
