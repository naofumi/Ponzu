# Author objects represent an Author of a Submission. Author
# objects are separate from User objects. User objects
# represent a User who can log into the system. On the
# other hand, Author objects are simply data that has
# been extracted from the Submissions.
#
# This is very different from the MBSJ2012 system. In the 
# MBSJ2012, we did not have Author objects but instead
# User objects served both roles (which was confusing).
#
# == Author objects do not contain Twitter IDs, etc.
#
# That stuff should be put into User objects.
#
# == Relationship with User objects.
#
# Author - User is a one-to-many relationship. This means
# that an Author may be associated with multiple Users.
#
# Ideally, an author should only have one user, but sometimes it doesn't work out that way.
# In the MBSJ2012, registration ID handout was confused so we had multiple registrants
# per author, and we had to consolidate those.
#
# In the new Ponzu, we decided not to consolidate. Instead, the system will merge information
# from multiple Users when we display the Author profile.
