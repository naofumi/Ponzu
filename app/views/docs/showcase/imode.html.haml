      # iMode is still strong

      The percentage of people using smartphones in Japan is still at less than 30% 
      according to data for the year 2012 (depends on the research company). Although
      the growth is strong, it will get slower as the market saturates and we should
      expect a significant number of people to still be using iMode in the mid-term.

      Kamishibai renders HTML and is very suited for iMode. We want to 
      create a few Rails libraries that make it even easier to share code between
      websites for various devices.

      # What should the library do

      Kamishibai handles iMode sites very well, and in most cases, the iMode site
      structure is very similar to the smartphone site structure. Therefore we
      can share controllers most of the time.

      The problem with iMode sites is that CSS is not supported very well and 
      therefore it is difficult to adjust to iMode simply by manipulating CSS; 
      you have to change the HTML as well. 

      One thing that could help would be to switch from ERB to HAML. HAML is a 
      more terse syntax so it might be easier to convert from a smartphone layout
      to a iMode layout. It might also be possible to do some automatic convertsion
      because HAML uses helpers extensively.

      # Some examples for conversion

      iMode sites do not use `li` tags for lists. Instead they use `â– ` directly in 
      the text. We should have helpers to make it easy to insert these.

    = galapagos_bullet
    This uses a square as a bullet with the
    %code galapagos_bullet
    helper. The code is pretty simple.
    %pre
      %code
        \= galapagos_bullet
        This uses a square as a bullet with the
        \%code galapagos_bullet
        helper. The code is pretty simple.
